Python Code that gets the songs present in the E:\\Music\\ folder and plays them. This Media player does not have a UI and can perform operations from anywhere in the system through certain keyboard commands.

Ctrl+Shift+1 = Stop (exits the media player)

Ctrl+Shift+2 = Play/Pause

Ctrl+Shift+3 = Next Song

Ctrl+Shift+4 = Previous Song

Ctrl+Shift+5 = Repeat current song

Issues to be fixed in this timeline:

1) The next song does not play after the current song is finished. Currently the user has to manually move to the next song.
2) When the current song is set on repeat, halfway through the song, the player will restart the song.
